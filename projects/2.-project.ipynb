    "In this example, we assume that the data is stored in a CSV file called 'data.csv'. The data contains columns for symptoms (e.g., Fever, Cough, Fatigue) and a label column for the disease. You need to preprocess the data to represent the symptoms and disease labels numerically if they are categorical.\n",

    "First, the code loads the data into a pandas DataFrame. Then, it defines the structure of the Bayesian network by specifying the dependencies between the symptoms and the disease. In this case, we assume a simple structure where the symptoms directly influence the disease.\n",
